Assignment: Project #3
Description:
A retail company must Ô¨Åle a monthly sales tax report listing the sales for the month
and the amount of sales tax collected. Write a program that asks for the month, the
year, and the total amount collected at the cash register (that is, sales plus sales tax).
Assume the state sales tax is 7.25 percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.

The program should display a report similar to:

Month: October 2013
--------------------
Total Collected: $ 26572.89
Sales: $ 24323.01
County Sales Tax: $ 501.38
State Sales Tax: $ 1002.75
Total Sales Tax: $ 1504.13 (not necessarily accurate numbers)
